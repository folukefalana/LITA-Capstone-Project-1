### Project Overview
---
This project aims to generate an insight into the sales performance of a retail store over some given period. The analysis begins with an exploration of sales data using Excel, where pivot tables are utilized to summarize total sales by product, region, and month. Key metrics, including average sales per product and total revenue by region, are calculated using Excel formulas. Additionally, supplementary reports are created to highlight any other interesting findings. The culmination of this analysis is an interactive Power BI dashboard that visually presents top-selling products, regional performance, and monthly sales trends, enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions based on the data.
